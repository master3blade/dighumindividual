# DIGHUM 101 Individual Project: COVID-19 Behavior Analysis  - Brendon Lin
This project is for the DIGHUM 101 individual project. This project aims to serve as a starting point for answering the question â€œAs the pandemic continued longer and longer, how did attitudes towards self-isolation and social distancing change around the globe?" COVID-19 was a once in a lifetime event that no one in the world wants to experience again. Utilizing current technology and all the technology that we have at our disposal, we can try and answer questions we have in hindsight for how we can better combat and hopefully stop pandemics from spreading as far as COVID did, taking into account cultural and economic factors. It uses a dataset from YouGov, which survyed people from countries worldwide on their opinions on social distancing, masking, sanitiation, among others. It is written in Python and utilizes Python and the libraries pandas and matplotlib.
